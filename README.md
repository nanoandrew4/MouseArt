# MouseArt
This program is modelled after IO Graph, which I saw on the internet and thought would be interesting to try and code,
and implement my own ideas into it. The purpose of the program is to track the mouse pointer position to draw lines on an
invisible canvas, which is later saved to an image. Other shapes appear based on actions or inactions, such as circles. 
Features mentioned may still be WIP.
